# Learning Kotlin from Head First Kotlin #

Hi!

I decided to thoroughly study the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language and for this I purchased the
book [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/)
by Dawn and David Griffiths.

I started on **July 27, 2021**.

## How does it work ##

The main purpose of this repository is to display my progress in learning the Kotlin language from this book. Gradually,
I will add simple programs and examples of completing some tasks to this repository.

## Technologies ##

- The programming language Kotlin ([AdoptOpenJDK version 11.0.10](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)) was chosen for
  development.

- Development was carried out in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Ultimate Edition (license for
  students).

- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) was used to track activity.

- [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) was used to schedule tasks.
